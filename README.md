- After getting your credentials find the find the `COVID.kt` file at `app/src/main/java/com/example/usingapis/` and put it your credentials in the Headers as described in the example below
```kotlin
@Headers(
        "x-rapidapi-key: YOUR_KEY",
        "x-rapidapi-host: covid-193.p.rapidapi.com",
        "useQueryString: true"
    )

@Headers(
    "x-rapidapi-key: YOUR_KEY",
    "x-rapidapi-host: covid-193.p.rapidapi.com",
    "useQueryString: true"
)
```
- Now you can click on the green arrow(▶) in the top right corner of your screen ( I assume that you have some kind of AVD or device attached to your computer ) and click it.
